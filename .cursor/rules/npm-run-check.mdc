After making code changes (including file creation or deletion), run `npm run check`, then follow these guidelines:

- ESlint issues should be handled by you, *unless* there's a judgement call (e.g., how to break up a component into smaller components, major removals, etc.).
- TypeScript issues should be handled by you.
- Knip issues should be reported to the user, but you can make recommendations..
